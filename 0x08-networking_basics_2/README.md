# 0x08. Networking basics #1

## DevOps | Network | SysAdmin

This project focuses on fundamental networking concepts in Linux systems, with practical Bash scripting tasks that manipulate name resolution and inspect network interfaces. All tasks are designed to run on **Ubuntu 20.04 LTS** and are validated by an automated checker running inside **Docker**.
