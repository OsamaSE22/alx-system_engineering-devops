# 0x07. Networking basics #0

This project introduces foundational networking concepts used in system administration and DevOps.  
It covers the OSI model, types of networks, IP addressing, basic protocols, and common diagnostic tools.

## Learning Objectives

### OSI Model
- Understand what the OSI model is.
- Know the 7 layers.
- Know how it is structured from lower to higher layers.

### LAN (Local Area Network)
- Typical usage.
- Typical physical/geographical size.

### WAN (Wide Area Network)
- Typical usage.
- Typical geographical scale.

### Internet & IP
- What the Internet is.
- What an IP address is.
- Types of IP addresses: private vs public.
- Meaning and purpose of `localhost`.
- What a subnet is.
- Why IPv6 was created.

### TCP and UDP
- The two main transport protocols for IP networks.
- The fundamental differences between TCP and UDP.
- What a port is.
- Ports to memorize:
  - **22** – SSH  
  - **80** – HTTP  
  - **443** – HTTPS
- Tool/protocol commonly used to check network connectivity: **ping / ICMP**.
